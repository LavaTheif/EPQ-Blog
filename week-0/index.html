        <h4><u>My Week</u></h4><br>
        <u>Tuesday</u><br>
        I asked Heather if she could be my supervisor on Friday, and she said she would get back to me for today.
        She told me that she would be able to, however she doesn't have a lot of free time, which is fine as the EPQ is
        supposed to be led by the student.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Wednesday</u><br>

        Today I have finished deciding on an exact question, and created a SWOT analysis for it, which is shown in the
        image to the right.  Although the information about it will mostly be online, I will be able to get some
        information from books, and many developers help work on interpreters which will allow me to (hopefully) find
        someone pretty easily.  I have decided to create my own interpreter as an artifact for my EPQ.<br>
        <br>
        I have also created this blog today.  Although it is all set up, I will still update it every now and then to
        fix compatibility with mobile browsers and to update the style.<br>
        <h4><u>Targets Met</u></h4>
        <li>Get a supervisor</li>
        <li>Decide on a question and complete a SWOT analysis on it</li>
        <li>Set up blog</li>

        <h4><u>Targets Not Met</u></h4>
        <li>Complete research booklet</li>
        I have completed the majority of the tasks in it, however I did not complete the final analysis tasks of the articles,
        as one of my friends from primary and secondary that I hadn't seen in a while met up with me.
